/*Create a Java program that models the relationships between humans, their personal details,
and the books they have written. The program should consist of three main classes: `Humans`, 
Person, and Book, with the following requirements:

1. Person Class:
   - Should store personal details: name and age.
   - Should maintain a list of books that the person has written (`ArrayList<Book>`).
   - Implement methods to:
     - Add a book to the person's list of written books.
     - Print the person's details (name and age).
     - Get the list of books the person has written.

2. Book Class:
   - Should store details about a book: name and publisher.
   - Should allow setting and getting its name and publisher.
   - Implement a method to print all details of the book.
   - (Optional based on your implementation) Store information about the author(s). If supporting multiple authors, 
     manage a list of `Person` objects representing the authors. Implement methods to add an author to a book and 
     retrieve the book's authors.

3. Humans Class:
   - Should maintain a collection of `Person` objects (`ArrayList<Person>`).
   - Implement methods to:
     - Add a new `Person` to the collection.
     - Retrieve a `Person` by name.
     - Print all data related to a specific `Person` by name, including their written books.

4. Main Class:
   - Create instances of `Person` and `Book`.
   - Assign books to authors.
   - Add `Person` instances to the `Humans` collection.
   - Retrieve and print details of a specific `Person` by name, including the books they have written.

Your program should demonstrate the ability to model these relationships and perform operations such as adding,
retrieving, and displaying data related to persons and their books. Use the `Main` class to instantiate objects,
establish relationships between them, and display information as specified.
