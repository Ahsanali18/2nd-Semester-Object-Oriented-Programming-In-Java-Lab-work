		/* When we write a program we made some mistakes while typing the program. A mistake may cause the program to 
		 produce an unexpected results. Errors are the wrong that can make a program to go wrong 
		
		There are two types of Errors
		1-Runtime Error 					2- CompileTime Error
		-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Compile Time Errors:
		All syntax errors--> compile time errors --> can be detected and displayed by the compiler.
		So when we run out program our compiler shows these errors which we have made during the program.
		 
		The most common compile time errors are:
		Missing semicolon
		Missing braces
		Using wrong typed variables/ declared variables
		Missing double "" coated in strings
		Use of undeclared variable
		Incompatible assignment/initialization
		Using = instead of == sign while comparing values.
		
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
										Runtime Error
		Sometimes it happens that our program compiles successfully and gives unexpected results, this may be due to wrong
		logic of the programmer.
		Like --> when we do something wrong at runtime like /0, accessing an element of an array out of its range,
		The file that we need does not exist, Storing the wrong type of values in an array and many more.
		 
		---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
											Exception
		An exception is a condition that is caused by runtime error. When java interpreter encounters an runtime error via 
		divide by zero, it creates an object and throws it. (i.e inform about the error).
		
		Now, if we have written the code to catch the exception and handle it properly. Otherwise the whole program 
		collapses, so the process of catching the exception occurs during the  runtime error is known as exception handling
