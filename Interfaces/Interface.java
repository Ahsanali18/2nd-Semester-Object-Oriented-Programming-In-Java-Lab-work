//	Interfaces --> strict doesnot allows 
//	int a;  // In interfacce all the instances variables are final by default and they can only be readed cannot be 
//				modified
//	In interface we cannot use normal methods which can be overloaded or overrided if we create it shows an error
/*	
	Three options 
	make it default  by using default keyword 
	abstract we cannot use abstract keyword (no need to use abstract keyword)
	private  use private keyword 
	
	if we wanna to use intefraces then we have to implement it 
	two benefits 
	multiple inheritance, hybrid 
	we write like
	class A1 implements I1,I2 {//code} --> multiple inheritance performe d
*/	
//	I1(){ //constructor } interfacce donot have  constructors 
//	one interface can extends another interface but donot implements it
//	we cannot extends normal class with interface
	
//	interface extends another interface
//	interface allows other classes to implement it but donot allow them to extends it
	
	
	
//	 Task --> explore  basic examples of interfaces and abstract classes
//	 Task --> write basic programs of Runnable Interface.
